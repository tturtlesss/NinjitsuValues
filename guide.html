        <h2>Value</h2></br>
        <p>Value is the amount someone is willing to pay for a scroll/item in a trade.</p>
        <p>When determining the value of a scroll/item, it is important to note that each scroll or item has only one value, base value. It is crucial to use the correct value when trading.</p>
        <p>When evaluating the fairness of a trade, it is important to consider both the value and demand for the item in question. We encourage you to carefully review the values of the items you wish to trade.</p></br>

        <h2>Demand</h2></br>
        <p>Demand refers to player interest in an item. The higher the rating, the higher the desirability.</p>
        <p>The demand for each item is rated on a scale of 1 to 10. If an item has a rating of 1 to 4, it means low demand. A rating of 5 to 7 means moderate demand. A rating of 8 to 10 means high demand.</p></br>
