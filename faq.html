            <h2>What is the difference between price and value?</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>Why is there colored text on each value card?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The colored text on each value card represents the rarity of the item. Different colors correspond to different rarity tiers (e.g., Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythical).</p>
            </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>What impact does demand have on value and trading?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Demand plays a crucial role in determining an item's value in trading. High demand for a particular item can drive its value up, while low demand can lower it.</p>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>Why do some scrolls/items have similar values but different demands?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Even if scrolls/items have similar base values, their demand can differ due to various factors such as in-game utility, aesthetic appeal, or popularity among players.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>I can't find a certain scroll/item on the website. What do I do?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>If you can't find a certain scroll/item on the website, it might be a newly released item that hasn't been added yet, or it could be a less common item. You can try checking back later or contacting the website administrators to request its addition.</p>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <h2>How do I report a bug?</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>To report a bug, you can usually contact the website administrators through discord @tturtlesss. Be sure to provide as much detail as possible about the bug, including steps to reproduce it and any relevant screenshots.</p>
